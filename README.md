secure data hiding in images using steganography:

In steganography, the image is used as a cover medium, and the secret data is encoded into the image's pixels, typically by modifying the least significant bits (LSB) of the image's color values. These changes are subtle and do not significantly alter the visual quality of the image, making it difficult to detect that any information has been hidden.
Key points
Cover Image: The original image that is used to conceal the secret data.

Secret Data: The information (text, files, or other forms) that is to be hidden.

Embedding Process: The method used to hide the data, such as LSB substitution or frequency-domain techniques like Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).

Extraction Process: The method to recover or extract the hidden data from the image, which often requires a key if the data is encrypted.

Security: The process should ensure that the hidden data remains undetectable and secure against unauthorized access or tampering.

Applications
This technique is widely used in various fields, including data security, copyright protection, and digital forensics,Military Systems
